# Reddit alert automation script
Started as a joke but came up to be useful.. this script will check if the website iimcat.ac.in has uploaded the response sheets to the website and once it does it will send a alert message to subreddit r/CATpreparation

I never though I would get so many upvotes for such a silly post..

The bot indeed worked and I was one may be the first person to login to the website
